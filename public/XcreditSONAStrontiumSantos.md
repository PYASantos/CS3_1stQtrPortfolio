## *Interesting Points*
* Because of the recent storms that has passed, it has been revealed that some projects that was meant for flood protection had never existed or had failed. 
thus he order the DPWH to release a list of all the flood control projects from the past 3 years and those accountable for them the failed ones will face charges. 
* Tech-voc, which lets students who are still in senior high school, already choose their career tracks which can help students who graduate to have an easier time finding jobs. 
* There will be an increase in PhilHealth's coverage for emergency room services, dengue, cancer, heart attack, and more.
* He is encouraging people to have a more active and healthier lifestyle because of the increase in the weight of Filipinos in their adult years. He mentioned activities like fun runs and zumba sessions. 

## *Weird  Points*
* Though it is not necessarily "weird", I found it interesting that Pres. BBM had focused more on sports during a part of his speech, which online was said to be a "rare occurence."
* Even though Pres. BBM said that the P20/kilo program is now doable, there had been many issues during its implementation and many are still sceptical if that price is even sustainable. 
* The Love Bus, which was a project started by the former first lady, Imelda Marcos, is now being "revived."

## *Reflection*
    In the 2025 SONA, Pres. Ferdinand Marcos Jr had mentioned many important topics, including the national budget allocations, where the education sectore had received the largest portion. He mentioned building baranggay child development centres, distributing lap tops to public school teachers, mental health in schools, and more. I really hope to see an improvement in the education system, especially considering learning crisis that the Philippines is experiencing. Another thing that stood out to me while listening to his speech was the Zero Billing Program. Though it is not new, it was nice to hear the PhilHealth will continue to cover the medical expenses of patients admitted to Department of Health (DOH) hospitals, as it will help Filipinos who struggle financially to still get the help they need. 

    While he mentioned many other topics that will help the economy, agriculture, health and more in the Philippines, there were still some things that I wish he addressed during his speech. One of which is Vice President Sara Duterteâ€™s impeachment as it has been recently been barred by the one-year rule and can be refiled next year. In conclusion, his speech was very informative and I hope that the plans and programs he mentioned will be done and implemented properly and lead real changes in the lives of Filipinos. 

## *1 word/phrase/or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?*
* There is still more that can be done.
